# P2P Messaging App

## Overview
This Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Messaging App allows users to communicate directly with each other over a network without requiring a central server. Each instance of the application can act as both client and server, enabling messages to be sent and received within different chatrooms.

## Features
- Simple text-based communication between clients.
- Ability to choose from multiple chatrooms (1, 2, or 3).
- Real-time message exchange using Python sockets.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9

### Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/p2p-messaging-app.git
cd p2p-messaging-app
```

## Running the Application

1. Open two separate terminal windows for the server and the client.
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
3. Run the client in a different terminal:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server using the command provided above.
2. Start one or more clients.
3. Enter your name and select a chatroom (1, 2, or 3) on each client to start sending messages.
4. Messages typed in one client can be seen in real-time in another client if they are in the same chatroom.
